# JavaZMach
A Z-Machine interpreter in Java

Many instructions aren't supported, but the interpreter is able to run ZORK1 (version Z3).

When importing this project in Eclipse, tick "Check for nested projects" in the import dialog.

There are currently two UI backends; located in JavaZMachConsoleUI and JavaZMachSWTUI.<br>
JavaZMachConsoleUI is not perfect as it has to emulate some Z-Machine screen functions.
